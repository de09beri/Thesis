\chapter{\uppercase{$^{227}$Ac as a Calibration Source}} \label{ch:Ac}

\section{Motivation}

In the absence of an eV-scale sterile neutrino PROSPECT should measure IBD rates that fall like one over distance from the reactor squared. 
If sterile neutrino oscillation was detected, after one year PROSPECT would measure the spectrum seen in Figure~\ref{fig:lovere1yr}, given a mass splitting of 1.78 eV$^2$, .
However, a situation could occur in which a sterile neutrino did not exist, or could not be measured with PROSPECT, and an oscillation is still measured.
This could happen if there are segment to segment volume variations throughout the detector, mimicking an oscillation signal.
Therefore, it becomes important that the product of efficiency$\times$volume for all segments is well known.

	\label{fig:lovere1yr}
\end{figure}


This measurement can be accomplished if an event source is uniformly distributed throughout the active volume of the detector. 
By measuring the rate of this source in each segment the relative volumes can be compared and tracked through time.
\Ac was chosen as the source and a chloride solution was prepared and dissolved in the liquid scintillator to ensure uniform distribution.

\Ac was chosen for several reasons. First, because an \AaAa coincidence occurs in its decay chain, specifically $^{219}$Rn $\rightarrow ^{215}$Po + $\alpha \rightarrow ^{211}$Pb + \Aa, as highlighted in Figure~\ref{fig:ac227chain}.
\Rn has a half-life of 3.96 $\pm$ 0.01 s and $\alpha$-decays 100\% of the time, while \Po has a half-life of 1.781 $\pm$ 0.005 ms and $\alpha$-decays  99.99977(2)\% of the time \cite{ENSDF}, so the \AaAa coincidences happen frequently.
The \Aa decay of \Po is mono-energetic at 7.39 MeV which results in a $\sim$0.78 MeVee signal after quenching, well removed from nLi captures that occur around 0.5 MeVee. 
In addition, there are no corresponding gammas with the \Po decay, making this a very clean and well defined signal.
The \Rn \Aa decays are not so nice, as there are four dominant alpha energies and three dominant gamma energies for these decays, as listed in Table~\ref{tab:RnPoE}, but the use of time, energy, and PSD cuts make them easy to pair with corresponding \Po decays.

\section{Material Compatibility}

Before \Ac could be added to the PROSPECT detector, it had to be determined that \Ac and its daughters would not adsorb onto detector materials.
If it was adsorbed then it would not be a uniform source in the detector, nullifying its use as a method to track relative efficiency$\times$volume throughout the detector.
To test this six material samples were placed in vials of $^6$Li-LS spiked with \Ac. The rate of \Ac in each sample vial and one reference vial with no material was measured and tracked over a period of 6 months. 
An observation of a significant decrease in rate, relative to the half-life of \Ac, would indicate that \Ac was adsorbing onto the material.

\subsection{Material and Scintillator Preparation}
The materials tested were: ultraviolet transmitting (UVT) acrylic, flourinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polylactide (PLA), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), a RG 188 cable, and viton o-rings. See Table~\ref{tab:materials} for a list of their uses in the detector and sample sizes.
To prepare the materials they were all placed in a single beaker with ultra-pure water and cleaned ultrasonically for 30 minutes.
They were then transferred to a watch glass and placed in a 50 C over for two hours.
After drying they were placed in empty 12 mL vials.

The \Ac used to spike the scintillator was obtained from Eckert and Ziegler as a solution of 3.711$\times$10$^4$ Bq $\pm$ 1.32\% of \Ac in 10.22710 g of 1 M HCl, measured on September 6, 2016.
0.503 g of this solution was added to 192 g of $^6$Li-LS on December 15, 2016.
With a half-life of 21.772 $\pm$ 0.003 yrs \cite{ENSDF}, the activity of the \Ac solution before adding to the LiLS was 36788 Bq, yielding a final activity of 94.2 Bq/10 g. 
This is the stock solution from which all LS was taken for the material studies and later on for spiking the detector.

Prior to filling all sample vials the threads of each vial were wrapped with teflon tape in an effort to obtain a secure seal. 
The reference vial was filled on December 15, 2016 with 10.030 g of \Ac spiked LiLS from the stock solution, yielding an expected activity of 94.5 Bq.
All material vials were filled on February 24, 2017 with the amount of stock solution added to each listed in Table~\ref{tab:MatFill}.
At the time of filling the rate in each vial was expected to be $\sim$93 Bq.
For a photograph of all filled material sample vials see Figure~\ref{fig:samples}.

\subsection{Detector}

The detector consisted of a 2'' photomultiplier tube coupled using optical grease to a solid cylinder of UVT acrylic painted white with an insert cut out to hold the sample vials, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:blackbox}.
Placed in a dark box the PMT is cabled to a CAEN DT55xx Desktop HV Power Supply and a CAEN DT5730 8 Channel 14-bit 500 MS/s Digitizer \cite{CAENDigit}.
A modified version of Wavedump 3.7.2 \cite{CAENWD} was used to start and stop the data runs and save the waveforms of the signals.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Analysis}

The raw waveforms are analyzed to calculate the energy, PSD, and time of each signal. 
The energy is determined by taking an integral of the waveform in ADC units and then converted to nC by... 
The PSD is defined as... \todo{DEFINE these values}

The \Ac coincident alpha events, labeled RnPo events for the remainder of this document, are found by applying a set of timing, energy, and PSD cuts along with an accidental background subtraction.
Po events are found first by applying the energy and PSD cuts listed in Tabel~\ref{tab:MatCuts}. 
Rn coincidental events are found by looking in a 12.85 ms time window before a given Po event and applying the same energy and PSD cuts.
This time window is 5 times the lifetime of Po, 2.57 ms, allowing the collection of all possible coincident events.
Accidental events are found by looking in the same length time window, using the same energy and PSD cuts, but offset 10 Po lifetimes before a given Po event.
RnPo events are then found by subtracting the accidental events from the coincident events.
See Figure~\ref{fig:rnpoenpsd} for an example of typical energy and PSD distributions.

	\begin{tabular}{c|c}

	\caption[Typical RnPo energy and PSD distributions]{Typical energy (a) and PSD (b) distributions for RnPo events in the reference sample after accidental background subtraction.}
	\label{fig:rnpoenpsd}
\end{figure}

The rate of RnPo events is measured by fitting the RnPo $\Delta$t distribution with
\begin{equation}
	f(t) = N_0e^{-t/\tau}
	\label{eq:MatDtFit}
\end{equation}
where $N_0$ and $\tau$, the lifetime of \Po, are allowed to vary. 
Using the fit results, the rate is then defined as
\begin{equation}
	R = \frac{N_0 \tau}{\textrm{bin-width}\times\textrm{livetime}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_R = R \times \sqrt{  \left(\frac{\sigma_{N_0}}{N_0}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_{\tau}}{\tau}\right)^2 + \frac{2\sigma_{N_{0}\tau}}{N_0\tau} }
\end{equation}
where the livetime is measured, for each run, as the time from the beginning of the run to the last Po event. 
An example of a typical RnPo $\Delta$t distribution can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rnpodttimebin23s2}. It should be noted here that the energy and PSD cuts were made wide enough so that no efficiency correction needed to be applied.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}

The RnPo rate was calculated for each material sample and the reference sample over a period of about six months. These results can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:ratevstimeallsamples}.
Though statistical errors vary from around 0.6-1\%, overall rates vary at a rate of around 12\%, indicating systematic variations.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{tex/6-ac227-images/BNL/RateVsTime_AllSamples}
	\caption[\Ac rate for each material sample]{\Ac rate for each material sample. Errors are statistical.}
	\label{fig:ratevstimeallsamples}
\end{figure}

Systematic variations can be better understood by looking at the behavior of the \Po energy distribution through time.
This was done by fitting this distribution for the reference sample with a sum of two Gaussians to account for the non-Gaussian nature of the peak as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:poenfittimebin23s2}.
The mean and 1$\sigma$ width of each of these Gaussians versus time is show in Figures~\ref{fig:poenmeanvstimes2} and ~\ref{fig:poenwidthvstimes2}.
It can be seen that the \Po energy mean varies about 5\% and the width around 15\%.

\begin{figure}[!b]

	\label{fig:poenfittimebin23s2}
\end{figure}

The amount of variation seen in measured rates and the \Po energy distribution indicate that the system is not repeatable and, as such, introduces significant systematic errors. 
Though the PMT and acrylic holder were glued in place, the sample vials were repeatedly removed and replaced, possibly shifting the placement of the acrylic holder and the optical grease.
If the experiment were to be repeated a more robust detector system would be needed to eliminate these systematic errors.

	\label{fig:poenwidthvstimes2}
\end{figure}

To account for these variations all material sample rates, $R_M$, were compared to the reference sample rate, $R_{ref}$.
The ratio of the rates was calculated for each time bin as
\begin{equation}
ratio = \frac{R_M}{R_{ref.}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ratio} = ratio \times \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_{M}}{R_{M}}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\sigma_{ref.}}{R_{ref.}}\right)^2}
\end{equation}
and the results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:relratevstimeallsamples}.
The ratio of rates versus time, for each material, were fit with a constant and a straight line, the results of which are tabulated in Tables~\ref{tab:MatFitC} and \ref{tab:MatFitLine} respectively.

Except for the case of viton (discussed in the next section) there is no clear decrease in rate observed over the six month period for any material.
Though the chi-squared results for the constant fits are not ideal, the fits to a straight line result in slopes with 50\% error to greater than 100\% error, indicating that a decrease in rate is not a good model.
Since no obvious and significant decrease was observed it was concluded that \Ac was not adsorbing onto materials and next steps were taken to include the source in the final detector.

\subsubsection{Viton}

Observation of the rate of \Ac in the viton o-ring material sample vial initially indicates a decrease in rate over time, about 10\% compared to the reference vial over a six month period.
Upon further inspection, though, it becomes clear that the energy spectrum, of the Rn events in particular, shift toward the system threshold as time goes on.
This causes a loss of events, not due to adsorbance, but rather due to threshold effects.

Figure~\ref{fig:rnpoenfirstandlast} shows the \Rn and \Po energy distributions in the first and last time bins for both viton and PEEK.
It can be seen that at the last time bin the viton distributions sit against the threshold, compared to the PEEK distributions which approach but do not get close to the threshold.
To quantify this the \Rn spectrum was fit with a sum of two Gaussians and the widths versus time are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rnenwidths8}.
It can be seen that the lower energy Gaussian becomes narrower as time goes on, indicating a loss of events due to threshold effects.
Therefore, it was concluded that the decrease in \Ac rate observed in the viton o-ring sample was due to threshold effects rather than adsorption.
