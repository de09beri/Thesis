\chapter{CONCLUSIONS}

All that is left is to provide instructions for how to convert the source into a PDF.

First navigate to the folder containing the thesis.tex source file in a terminal window
or at a command prompt.  (This will be "thesis\_template" in my example).

Then run the command "pdflatex thesis.tex".  There will be lots of undefined references, but hopefully
no show stopping errors.

Then run the command "pdflatex thesis.tex" again.  This should fix all the references that
were errors last time.

The file thesis.pdf should now hold the final thesis document.
