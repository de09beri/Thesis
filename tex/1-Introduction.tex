\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

This is the start for the body of the thesis.  Citations are in this format~\cite{amb}, and should be
listed at the end in order of appearance. The tilde provides a space between you text and
the reference. The reference index (e.g. amb) is defined in the References file.  

Figures follow a similar format, as seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:test1}.  The index for the 
figure is defined in the label command, seen after the caption in this example.  The path
to the file referenced in the includegraphics command is based from the location of the thesis.tex
file that you must compile to generate the final document.  The 1.0 on the same line is used 
to scale the image appropriately (i.e. use 0.5 instead to shrink to half the width).
